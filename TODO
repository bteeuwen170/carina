General (AKA angry notes to self)
- No typdeffing for kernelspace structures
- No string typedef, WTF
- RESERVED IS ___NOT___ THE SAME AS UNUSED!!!
- Create devel branch once basic posix things are implemented like vfs and pipes
- Don't cast unused to void, use gcc flag instead

Bootloader
- Write own bootloader

Kernel
- Check if all errno are used
- Fix unable to fit without stripping kernel

- Always return void from initialization functions
- Move paging source file to cpu/
- Don't include arch specific files outside of arch dir

- Inconsistency between use of kernel integer data types and
  C integer data types
- Split all driver header files into it's own directory
- FIXME PCI bug, handler isn't called after reboot (dirty memory)
